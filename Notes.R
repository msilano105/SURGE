# Process model is tradationally what people think a model is. 
# That wil be the explanation of the change in the true value of the variable.
# How is the observations (data) related to the change in the true value of the variable you are looking at (SURGE).  
# The data model relates the observations to the true value of the variable.
# Predicted surge to observed surge is data model. 
# The data describes the error in the observation process themselves and do propagate through time.
